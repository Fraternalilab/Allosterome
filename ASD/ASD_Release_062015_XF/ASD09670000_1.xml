  <Function_Summary>Catalyzes the retro-aldol cleavage of both 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate (HOPA) and 4-hydroxy-2-oxohexanoate (HOHA) to pyruvate and acetaldehyde or propanaldehyde, respectively. The aldehydes produced by this reaction are directly channeled from BphI to the dehydrogenase BphJ, ensuring that these toxic aldehydes are sequestered from cellular components. Is involved in the meta-cleavage pathway for the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Appears to be stereospecific since it can cleave (4S)-4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate but not the (4R) isomer. Also exhibits a secondary oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity. Finally, is also able to catalyze the reverse reaction, albeit much less efficiently, i.e. the condensation of aldehyde acceptors of two to three carbons in length with pyruvate. This aldol addition reaction is stereospecific; the condensation of acetaldehyde and pyruvate with BphI produces only the (4S)-4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate isomer. Aldehyde channeling in the BphI-BphJ complex can occur in reverse, from the dehydrogenase to the aldolase active sites, and the BphJ reductive deacylation reaction increases 4-fold when BphI is catalyzing the aldol addition reaction. Therefore, the BphI-BphJ enzyme complex exhibits unique bidirectionality in substrate channeling and allosteric activation.</Function_Summary>

    <Funtion>
      <Detail>Catalysis of a biochemical reaction at physiological temperatures. In biologically catalyzed reactions, the reactants are known as substrates, and the catalysts are naturally occurring macromolecular substances known as enzymes. Enzymes possess specific binding sites for substrates, and are usually composed wholly or largely of protein, but RNA that has catalytic activity (ribozyme) is often also regarded as enzymatic.</Detail>

      <Detail>Catalysis of the cleavage of C-C, C-O, C-N and other bonds by other means than by hydrolysis or oxidation, or conversely adding a group to a double bond. They differ from other enzymes in that two substrates are involved in one reaction direction, but only one in the other direction. When acting on the single substrate, a molecule is eliminated and this generates either a new double bond or a new ring.</Detail>
