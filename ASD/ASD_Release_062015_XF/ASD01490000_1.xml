  <Function_Summary>Catalyzes the ATP- as well as the pyrophosphate-dependent phosphorylation of 'Ser-45' in HPr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). HprK/P also catalyzes the pyrophosphate-producing, inorganic phosphate-dependent dephosphorylation (phosphorolysis) of seryl-phosphorylated HPr (P-Ser-HPr). The two antagonistic activities of HprK/P are regulated by several intracellular metabolites, which change their concentration in response to the absence or presence of rapidly metabolisable carbon sources (glucose, fructose, etc.) in the growth medium. Also phosphorylates/dephosphorylates the HPr-like catabolite repression protein crh on 'Ser-46'. Therefore, by controlling the phosphorylation state of HPr and crh, HPrK/P is a sensor enzyme that plays a major role in the regulation of carbon metabolism and sugar transport: it mediates carbon catabolite repression (CCR), and regulates PTS-catalyzed carbohydrate uptake and inducer exclusion.</Function_Summary>

    <Funtion>
      <Detail>Catalysis of a biochemical reaction at physiological temperatures. In biologically catalyzed reactions, the reactants are known as substrates, and the catalysts are naturally occurring macromolecular substances known as enzymes. Enzymes possess specific binding sites for substrates, and are usually composed wholly or largely of protein, but RNA that has catalytic activity (ribozyme) is often also regarded as enzymatic.</Detail>

      <Detail>Catalysis of the phosphorylation of a histidine residue in response to detection of an extracellular signal such as a chemical ligand or change in environment, to initiate a change in cell state or activity. The two-component sensor is a histidine kinase that autophosphorylates a histidine residue in its active site. The phosphate is then transferred to an aspartate residue in a downstream response regulator, to trigger a response.</Detail>
